Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

Note:

Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.
Example:

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2

func twoSum167(numbers []int, target int) []int {
	res := make([]int, 0, 2)
	i, j := 0, len(numbers)-1
	for i < j {
		if numbers[i]+numbers[j] < target {
			i++
		} else if numbers[i]+numbers[j] > target {
			j--
		} else {
			res = append(res, i, j)
			break
		}
	}
	return res
}
